**This is a submission to Godot Wild Jam #80.**

In this game, you are a CapsuleMan that will try to keep his food and his water bars high by collecting coconuts (water) and mangos (food). If one of the two goes down to zero, he will die. The game is split into 20 days that he have to survive, each day being more complex than the previous one.

But beware, because in the deep of the night the ground may shiftâ€¦

Good luck!


**Known bugs:** In the pause menu, the mouse doesn't work. You will have to use the keyboard only. I tried to fix it, but I didn't manage. If anyone has an idea of why this happens and a possible fix, please email me at samdug@protonmail.com or open an issue.
